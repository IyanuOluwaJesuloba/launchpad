# 🚀 Soroban Token Launchpad

An open-source, full-stack platform for deploying and managing SEP-41 compliant tokens on the Stellar Soroban smart contract platform — no code required.

Built for founders, DAOs, and developers who need a clean interface to launch tokens with vesting schedules, mint/burn controls, and treasury management.

> **Scope:** SoroPad deploys and manages tokens. It does not create a market for them — there is no liquidity pool, swap, or price quote. To trade a token you launch, list it on a Stellar DEX or AMM of your choice. See [PRD.md](PRD.md) ®4.

> **Risk notice:** Transactions are submitted through your wallet and may be irreversible. Tokens can be volatile or lose all value. SoroPad does not provide custody, warranties, or financial advice. See [RISK.md](RISK.md).
